This is a test run on the road with a probe with no baro sensor but
all the other sensors installed. Attempting to figure out where the
problem of "spikes" in the data comes from. The data is quiet on the
bench but as seen here, after driving for a while, the spikes come
in. Suspecting poor board manufacture.
