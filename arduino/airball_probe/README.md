# Arduino firmware for the Airball Probe

This is the firmware for the Airball Probe, which is based loosely on (and compatible with) the [Sparkfun Fio v3](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11520). A brand new probe (or one which has been damaged/bricked) will need to be [bootstrapped with a bootloader via ICSP](doc/Bootstrapping_an_Airball_Probe.md) After bootstrapping it can be [programmed using the Arduino IDE](doc/Programming_an_Airball_Probe.md) to install the `airball_probe` firmware.
